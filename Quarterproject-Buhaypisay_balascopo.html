            Pisay, short for the Philippine Science High School (PSHS), stands as a distinguished public high school system in the Philippines, operating under the aegis of the Department of Science and Technology. Established in 1963 through Republic Act 3661, Pisay's primary objective is to offer scholarships to high school students displaying exceptional proficiency in science and mathematics. Its curriculum, emphasizing these subjects, is meticulously crafted to equip students for future careers in science and technology. The PSHS, comprising 16 campuses across the country, was founded by President Diosdado Macapagal, as outlined in the PSHS Charter. This legislative act, signed into law in 1964, mandates the provision of a secondary education with a focus on science subjects, all offered on a tuition-free scholarship basis. Pisay takes pride in being the premier science high school in the Asia Pacific Region, dedicated to preparing scholars to become globally competitive Filipino scientists. With a commitment to instilling 21st-century skills and fostering core values such as Integrity, Excellence, and Service to Nation, Pisay is at the forefront of nurturing the next generation of scientific leaders.
