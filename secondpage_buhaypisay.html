By doing this method, you are reinforcing your existing knowledge of the subject, actively enhancing your comprehension and retention of the concept.</p>

			<p>This is very helpful when studying for examinations and long quizzes. This will help you remember the lessons better and understand the concepts more.</p>

Please do not sacrifice your health in return of your desired scores and grades. Always remember that your well-being is your utmost priority.</p>
			<li>Don’t hate the subject that you find hard !!!</li>
			<p>Hating the subject will only make you lose interest in improving in the subject. Instead, use your frustration as an inspiration to do better on the subject. </p>
			<li>embrace challenges as opportunities for growth</li>
			<p>mistakes are room from improvement. Don't let your mistakes or failures define who you are. Use them as an opportunity to grow and improve your skills. Never give up.</p>
			<li>celebrate your achievements no matter how small they are</li>
			<p>Be contented of your achievements and don't compare your skills to others. Everyone is special and has their own strengths and weaknesses. It is important that you focus on your own growth rather than competing with others.</p>
